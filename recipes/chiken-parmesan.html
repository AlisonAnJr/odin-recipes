    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. 
    And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts, about 8 oz each, sliced in half lengthwise to make 8</li>
        <li>3/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs, I used whole wheat, you can also use GF crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, melted (or olive oil)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup reduced fat mozzarella cheese, I used Polly-o</li>
        <li>1 cup marinara</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Spray a large baking sheet lightly with spray.</li>
        <li>Combine breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese in a bowl. Melt the butter in another bowl. Lightly brush the butter onto the chicken, then dip into breadcrumb mixture.  Place on baking sheet and repeat with the remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Lightly spray a little more oil on top and bake in the oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, spoon 1 tbsp sauce over each piece of chicken and top each with 1 1/2 tbsp of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake 5 more minutes or until cheese is melted</li>
    </ol>
